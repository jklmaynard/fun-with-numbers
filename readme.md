Every once in a while, I find equations I like to poke around with on a calculator; very quickly, I realize that instead of tracking it out on a calculator I might as well just write a javascript function for the equation, and throw up a quick website.  The consequences are little, really, insignificant: it is perhaps only for my own edification (so much is).  

This site is bringing those little functions together, spending some time out of the week flexing the CSS and jQuery muscles.
